CSSolar System
==============

This simple project was an experiment in using CSS animations to represent to orbits of the planets in our solar system. This tool was designed to be used to teach the basics of our solar system in schools.

Users can attempt to label each planet by clicking and dragging to planet label to the correct orbit, or autocomplete to show the correct labelling.

The orbit counts are calculated and displayed to show how each planet orbit compared to our own using Javascript.
